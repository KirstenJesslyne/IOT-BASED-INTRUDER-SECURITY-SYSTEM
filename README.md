# IOT-BASED-INTRUDER-SECURITY-SYSTEM
This project is a simple IoT-based security system designed to detect intruders using an ultrasonic sensor and ESP32. When motion is detected within a certain range, the system activates LEDs as visual alerts and sends a real-time notification to a smartphone using the Blynk app. Itâ€™s ideal for basic home or room security applications.
